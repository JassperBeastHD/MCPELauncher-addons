# MCPELauncher Addons by 500 Internal Server Error

This is a collection of addons for Android Minecraft PE, designed to be loaded by MCPELauncher.

The addons are built with a slightly modified Android NDK.

For usage instructions, see http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1713401-/ .

## To build
 - Setup the Android NDK (I use version r8c)
 - Copy libmcpelauncher.so and libminecraftpe.so to android-ndk-r8c/platforms/android-14/arch-arm/usr/lib
 - run ndk-build in the directory of your choice

## Redistribution
 - Ask me before redistributing anything from this site. A PM sent to me on Minecraft Forums is the best way to contact me.
